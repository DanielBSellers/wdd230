            <p><strong>I-15 crash kills 
            3, forces temporary closure of roadway in Farr West</strong><br>
            FARR WEST — A crash on Interstate 15 early Wednesday morning
             killed three and led to the temporary closure of the 
             northbound lanes of the road in the area as officials 
             cleared the road and investigated. The accident occurred 
             around 2:45 a.m. Wednesday after a northbound vehicle, a 
             Nissan Altima, hit a deer while in the left-hand traffic 
             lane, according to a Utah Highway Patrol statement. The 
             driver then pulled to the right-hand lane and slowed down 
             or stopped. “A short time later, a white Freightliner semi
             approached the Altima and did not see it in time before 
             running into the back of it,” according to the statement. 
             The crash occurred around milepost 349 in Farr West. 
             Three people, all seated in the backseat of the Nissan, 
             sustained fatal injuries and died on the scene. “The driver
             and front seat passenger sustained serious injuries and were
              transported to an area hospital. The driver of the semi 
              was not injured in the crash,” reads the statement. 
              Officials didn’t name the three people who died but 
              identified them as a 70-year-old man, a 64-year-old woman 
              and a 17-year-old female. The adults were from Enid, 
              Oklahoma, while the teen was from the Marshall Islands. 
              The northbound I-15 lanes were closed in the area after 
              the crash, with traffic forced off the roadway at the 2700 
              North exit in Farr West. At around 6:50 a.m. Wednesday, 
              the roadway had reopened at the location to two-way 
              traffic.</p></div>
