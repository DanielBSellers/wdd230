    <div id=grid><div class="exBody"><h2 id="h2first">Visual Hierarchy</h2>
    <h3 id="h3first">Mozilla: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"target="_blank">Visit Site</a></h3>
    <!-- <img class="imageGrid" id="vis" src="Images/VH.png" alt="Example of Visual Hierarchy" width="400"> -->
    <img class="exImg" src="Images/VH-sc.jpg" alt="Example of Visual Hierarchy on Mobile" width="200">
    <p>I chose this as an example of Visual Hierarchy because the way it is formatted makes it easy to tell what
        to look at and when to look at it. This is done by having what is on top be the larger heading and further 
        down on the page the smaller text. In that type of progression, common conventions tell the brain that 
        what is about to be read builds on what was previously read.</p><br></div>
    <div class="exBody"><h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
    <h3>Digital Camera World: <a href="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/the-10-most-instagrammable-landmarks-in-the-world-how-many-have-you-shot"target="_blank">Visit Site</a></h3>
    <!-- <img class="imageGrid" id="rule" src="Images/ROT.png" alt="Example of Rule of Thirds" width="400"> -->
    <img class="exImg" id="ruleSc" src="Images/ROT-sc.jpg" alt="Example of Rule of Thirds on mobile" width="200">
    <p>I chose this site as an example of the Rule of Thirds because the 
        rule of thirds is used to structure the content in a way that is naturally pleasing to the brain. In the mobile
        version, the content is broken up
        into three sections, going top to bottom. This is not only true in the example I displayed, but were one to 
        keep scrolling they would find that to be the case throughout the article.</p><br></div>
    <div class="exBody"><div id="needToSpan"><h2>White Space &amp; Clean Design</h2>
    <h3>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/"target="_blank">Visit Site</a></h3>
    <!-- <img class="imageGrid" id="whit" src="Images/WS.png" alt="Example of White Space" width="400"> -->
    <img class="exImg" id="whitSc" src="Images/WS-sc.jpg" alt="Example of White Space on mobile" width="200">
    <p>The example I have chosen to use for white space and clean design is a site that likley everyone is familiar with.
        Instagram uses white space to clearly separate when certain elements stop and when the next element begins.</p><br></div></div></div>
